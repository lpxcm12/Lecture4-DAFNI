# Lecture4-DAFNI

Using **github** we can share code and files across *many different people* without needing to email consistently. If we make a mistake we can always ~~cross it out~~ particularly if the text is **extremely _important_**

We can also do quotes
> like this

You can also do tick lists to keep up with a 'To do' list

- [x] Go to lecture
- [ ] down coffee
- [ ] put a wash on
